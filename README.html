## Installation & Setup

### System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or above
- **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher (auto-installable on Windows 10+)
- **Disk Space:** ~50MB for Python and libraries
- **RAM:** 512MB minimum

> **Good News:** The script can automatically install Python on Windows 10 and above using Windows Package Manager (winget).

### Requirements

This tool requires **Python** to be installed on your system.

> **Important:** If you get an error saying "Python is not installed or not in PATH", follow the installation steps below.

### Option 1: Auto-Install Python (Windows 10/11)

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
winget install Python.Python.3.12
```

*This uses Windows Package Manager to automatically install Python.*

### Option 2: Manual Python Installation

1. Visit [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Click the yellow "Download Python" button
3. Run the downloaded installer
4. **IMPORTANT:** Check the box "Add Python to PATH" at the bottom
5. Click "Install Now" and wait 2-3 minutes
6. Close and reopen PowerShell
7. Verify by running: `python --version`

> **First Run:** When you run the tool for the first time, it will automatically install the required PyMuPDF library.

## How It Works

### Output File Format

**Example:**
- **Input:** Document.pdf
- **Output Location:** OUTPUT/Document_20251024.pdf (created on October 24, 2025)

*Note: All encrypted files are saved to the **OUTPUT** folder. The original file remains unchanged. If a file with the same date already exists, it will append _1, _2, etc.*

**Multiple files on same day:**
- OUTPUT/Document_20251024.pdf
- OUTPUT/Document_20251024_1.pdf
- OUTPUT/Document_20251024_2.pdf

### Encryption Settings

- **Encryption:** AES-256 (strongest available)
- **User Password:** Required to open and view the PDF (can print in high-quality)
- **Owner Password:** Full access - can copy, modify, and annotate the PDF
- **Permissions:** High-quality printing allowed for all, Copying/Modification allowed with owner password

### Password Setup

> **Fast & Simple:** No password confirmation required! Just type once and go.

**Recommended password strength:** At least 8 characters including uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

The tool will warn you if your password doesn't meet these requirements, but will allow you to proceed if you confirm.

### User vs Owner Password

- **Same password (default):** You get full access to view, print, copy, and modify
- **Different passwords:** Share user password for view-only access, keep owner password for full editing rights

> **Owner Password Requirements:** If you choose a different owner password, it must be at least **12 characters** and **different from the user password**.

### Permission Comparison

| Action | User Password | Owner Password |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Open & View PDF | ✅ | ✅ |
| Print PDF (High-Quality) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Copy Text/Images | ❌ | ✅ |
| Modify Content | ❌ | ✅ |
| Add Annotations | ❌ | ✅ |

## Security Notes

> **Password Visibility:** Passwords are displayed on screen when you type them. Ensure no one is looking over your shoulder.

- Original files remain unchanged - a new encrypted copy is created
- AES-256 encryption is the same standard used by governments and military
- Password cannot be recovered if forgotten - keep it safe!
- Files expire after 30 days (for data retention compliance)

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Python is not installed or not in PATH"

**Solution:** Install Python using one of the methods in the Installation section above.

### Error: "PyMuPDF installation failed"

**Solution:** Manually install by opening PowerShell and running:

```powershell
pip install PyMuPDF
```

### Script won't run - "running scripts is disabled"

**Solution:** Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### PDF file not found

**Solution:** Make sure the PDF file path is correct and the file exists. Use drag-and-drop to avoid typing errors.
